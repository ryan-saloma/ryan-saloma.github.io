In the diagnostic criteria for lvPPA (Gorno-Tempini et al. 2011), “speech (phonologic) errors in spontaneous speech and naming” is a secondary criterion, but studies of naming error patterns in PPA have not found evidence to support this criterion. Furthermore, only a few studies have examined naming error patterns in PPA. In the current study, we examined the pattern of naming errors for nouns and verbs in all three subtypes of PPA, as well as unclassifiable PPA and typical (amnestic) Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Statistical analyses focused on three common error types: phonological, semantic, and circumlocution errors.
